OVERVIEW OF THE DASBORAD

Tash 1-Create a sales performance dashboard to visualize sales data, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and analyze trends. Import sales data from a CSV or Excel file. Create visuals such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts

This dashboard appears to provide insights into sales and profit performance. Here's a breakdown of the visualizations:

Bar Chart: "Sum of Profit and Sum of Sales Amount by Product"

Displays the profit and sales amount for various products.
Each product is represented on the y-axis, and the x-axis shows the corresponding values for both profit (green bars) and sales amount (blue bars).
Pie Chart: "Sum of Profit by Region"

Highlights the contribution of different regions (West, East, North, South) to the overall profit.
Each segment is labeled with the profit value and its percentage share of the total.
Line Chart: "Sum of Profit by Region"
Shows the profit distribution across regions in descending order (West, East, North, South).
Indicates a gradual decrease in profit moving across the regions.
KPI Card: "2.51M Sum of Profit"

Displays the total profit from all regions and products combined.
The dashboard effectively conveys an overview of how products and regions contribute to sales and profits, enabling data-driven decision-making.
